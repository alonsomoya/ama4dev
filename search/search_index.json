Types of errors There two main types of errors are: Client : typically occur when the request has not been properly built. Server : occur when there is an issue on the server side. Client errors If your API request is invalid, you will receive a Client Error response with an HTTP 4xx status code. The body of the response will match the format defined in our swagger schema and provide details about the error. Authorization errors 400 Bad request - Unsupported grant type Occurs when using a grant type other than client credentials . For more information, read our Authorization Guide . { \"error\" : \"unsupported_grant_type\" , \"error_description\" : \"Only client_credentials value is allowed for the body parameter grant_type\" , \"code\" : 38187 , \"title\" : \"Invalid parameters\" } 401 Unauthorized - Invalid access token Occurs when the access token provided in the Authorization header is expired or not longer valid. You must generate a new token. { \"errors\" : [ { \"code\" : 38190 , \"title\" : \"Invalid access token\" , \"detail\" : \"The access token provided in the Authorization header is invalid\" , \"status\" : 401 } ] } 401 Unauthorized - Invalid client Occurs when the client credentials have an invalid format and are not recognized. { \"error\" : \"invalid_client\" , \"error_description\" : \"Client credentials are invalid\" , \"code\" : 38187 , \"title\" : \"Invalid parameters\" } Data Format Errors 400 Bad request - Invalid format Occurs when an input query parameter is incorrect. In the example below, the Airport & City Search API returns an error because the location parameter is not in the expected IATA standard. { \"errors\" : [ { \"status\" : 400 , \"code\" : 477 , \"title\" : \"INVALID FORMAT\" , \"detail\" : \"City/Airport - 3 characters [IATA code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code) from which the traveler will depart.\" , \"source\" : { \"parameter\" : \"origin\" } } ] } Resource Errors 404 Not found - Resource not found Occurs when the endpoint or URL does not exist.

The body will match the defined error format, allowing your application to read it and display an appropriate message to the client. It may also contain debugging information which you can submit to us to further investigate the error. 500 Internal error { \"errors\" : [ { \"code\" : 38189 , \"title\" : \"Internal error\" , \"detail\" : \"An internal error occured, please contact your administrator\" , \"status\" : 500 } ] }","title":"Common Errors"},{"location":"common-errors/#common-client-and-server-errors","text":"Amadeus for Developers Self-Service APIs use HTTP status codes to communicate whether a request has been successfully processed.","title":"Common client and server errors"},{"location":"common-errors/#types-of-errors","text":"There two main types of errors are: Client : typically occur when the request has not been properly built.

For example, when calling the Safe Place API , you may get a response hundreds of pages long. That's where pagination comes in. Using pagination, you can split the results into different pages to make the responses easier to handle. Not all Amadeus Self-Service APIs support pagination. The following APIs currently support pagination: Safe Place Points of Interest Airport Nearest Relevant Airport & City Search Hotel Search v2 Flight Most Travelled Destinations Flight Most Booked Destinations Accessing paginated results Using SDKs Amadeus for Developers SDKs make it simple to access paginated results. If the API endpoint supports pagination, you can get page results using the the .next , .previous , .last and .first methods. Example in Node : amadeus . referenceData . locations . get ({ keyword : 'LON' , subType : 'AIRPORT,CITY' }). then ( function ( response ){ console . log ( response . data ); // first page return amadeus . next ( response ); }). then ( function ( nextReponse ){ console . log ( nextReponse . data ); // second page }); If a page is not available, the response will resolve to null . The same approach is valid for other languages, such as Ruby : response = amadeus . reference_data . locations . get ( keyword : 'LON' , subType : Amadeus :: Location :: ANY ) amadeus . next ( response ) #=> returns a new response for the next page In this case, the method will return nil if the page is not available. Manually parsing the response The response will contain the following JSON content: { \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 28 , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/airports?latitude=49.0000&longitude=2.55\" , \"next\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/airports?latitude=49.0000&longitude=2.55&page%5Boffset%5D=10\" , \"last\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/airports?latitude=49.0000&longitude=2.55&page%5Boffset%5D=18\" } }, \"data\" : [ { /* large amount of items */ } ] } You can access the next page of the results using the value of meta/links/next or meta/links/last node within the JSON response. Note that indexing elements between pages is done via the page[offset] query parameter. For example, page[offset]=18 . The next and last returned in the example above encode the special characters [] as %5B and %5D .

Click on Register . Complete the form using a valid email address and click on the Create account button. An automatic confirmation email will be sent to the email address you provided. In the confirmation email you receive, click on Activate your account . You can now log in to the portal with your new credentials! Welcome to Amadeus for Developers ! Step 2: Get your API key To start using the APIs, you need to tell the system that you are allowed to do so. This process is called authorization. Danger Remember that the API Key and API Secret are for personal use only. Do not share them with anyone. All you need to do, is to attach an alphanumeric string called token to your calls. This token will identify you as a valid user. Each token is generated from two parameters: API Key and API Secret . Once your account has been verified, you can get your API key and API Secret by following these steps: Sign in to the Developers Portal . Click on your username (located in the top right corner of the Developers portal page) Go to My Self-Service Workspace . Click on Create New App button. Enter your application details and click on Create . Important Test environment At this stage, you are using the testing environment, where you will enjoy a fixed number of free API call quotas per month for all your applications. When you reach the limit, you will receive an error message. This environment will help you build and test your app for free and get ready for deploying it to the market. Step 3: Calling the API For our first call, let's get a list of possible destinations from Paris for a maximum amount of 200 EUR using the Flight Inspiration Search API , which returns a list of destinations from a given origin along with the cheapest price for each destination. Creating the Request Before making your first API call, you need to get your access token . For security purposes, we implemented the oauth2 process that will give you an access token based on your API Key and API Secret. To retrieve the token , you need to send a POST request to the endpoint /v1/security/oauth2/token with the correct Content-Type header and body. Replace {client_id} with your API Key and {client_secret} with your API Secret in the command below and execute it: curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -d \"grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}\" Warning Please take a look at our Authorization guide to understand how the process works in depth. According to the documentation, you need to use v1/shopping/flight-destinations as the endpoint, followed by the mandatory query parameter origin . As you want to filter the offers to those cheaper than 200 EUR, you need to add the maxPrice parameter to your query as well. Our call is therefore: curl 'https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=PAR&maxPrice=200' \\ -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABCDEFGH12345' Note how we add the Authorization header to the request with the value Bearer string concatenated with the token previously requested. Evaluating the Response The response returns a JSON object containing a list of destinations matching our criteria: { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"PAR\" , \"destination\" : \"CAS\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2022-09-06\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2022-09-11\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"161.90\" } }, { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"PAR\" , \"destination\" : \"AYT\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2022-10-16\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2022-10-31\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"181.50\" } } ] } Congratulations!

OAuth generates an access token which grants the client permission to access a protected resource. The method to acquire a token is called grant . There are different types of OAuth grants . Amadeus for Developers uses the Client Credentials Grant . Requesting an access token Once you have created an app and received your API Key and API Secret , you can generate an access token by sending a POST request to the authorization server: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token/ Information Remember that your API Key and API Secret should be kept private. Read more about best practices for secure API key storage . The body of the request is encoded as x-www-form-urlencoded , where the keys and values are encoded in key-value tuples separated by '&', with a '=' between the key and the value: Key Value grant_type The value client_credentials client_id The API Key for the application client_secret The API Secret for the application Specify the type of the request using the content-type HTTP header with the value application/x-www-form-urlencoded . The following example uses cURL to request a new token: curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -d \"grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}\" Note that the -X POST parameter is not needed in the cURL command. As we are sending a body, cURL sends the request as POST automatically. Response The authorization server will respond with a JSON object: { \"type\" : \"amadeusOAuth2Token\" , \"username\" : \"foo@bar.com\" , \"application_name\" : \"BetaTest_foobar\" , \"client_id\" : \"3sY9VNvXIjyJYd5mmOtOzJLuL1BzJBBp\" , \"token_type\" : \"Bearer\" , \"access_token\" : \"CpjU0sEenniHCgPDrndzOSWFk5mN\" , \"expires_in\" : 1799 , \"state\" : \"approved\" , \"scope\" : \"\" } The response will contain the following parameters: Parameter Description type The type of resource. The value will be amadeusOAuth2Token . username Your username (email address). application_name The name of your application. client_id The API Key for your application token_type The type of token issued by the authentication server. The value will be Bearer . access_token The token to authenticate your requests. expires_in The number of seconds until the token expires. state The status of your request. Values can be approved or expired . Using the token Once the token has been retrieved, you can authenticate your requests to Amadeus Self-Service APIs. Each API call must contain the authorization HTTP header with the value Bearer {access_token} , where acess_token is the token you have just retrieved. The following example is a call to the Flight Check-in Links API to retrieve the check-in URL for Iberia ( IB ): curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links?airline=IB\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer CpjU0sEenniHCgPDrndzOSWFk5mN\" Managing tokens from your source code To retrieve a token using your favourite programming language, send a POST request and parse the JSON response as in the cURL examples above. There are different strategies to maintain your token updated, like checking the time remaining until expiration before each API call or capturing the unauthorized error when the token expires. In both cases, you must request a new token. To simplify managing the authentication process, you can use the Amadeus for Developers SDKs available on GitHub. The SDKs automatically fetch and store the access_token and set the headers in all API calls. Example of initializing the client and authenticating with the Node SDK: var Amadeus = require ( 'amadeus' ); var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ clientId : '[API Key]' , clientSecret : '[API Secret]' }); You can then call the API. The following example is a call to the Flight Check-in Links API to retrieve the check-in URL for Iberia ( IB ): var Amadeus = require ( 'amadeus' ); var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ clientId : '[API Key]' , clientSecret : '[API Secret]' }); amadeus . referenceData . urls . checkinLinks . get ({ airlineCode : 'IB' }). then ( function ( response ){ console . log ( response . data ); }). catch ( function ( responseError ){ console . log ( responseError . code ); });","title":"Authorization"},{"location":"API-Keys/authorization/#authorizing-your-application","text":"Amadeus for Developers uses OAuth to authenticate access requests.

Thailand? or Costa Rica? Do I need to have a PCR test? before the flight? after I arrive? How many days of quarantine are required? Where can I find this information?\" Don't worry, with Amadeus Self-Service APIs, you will be able to get detailed information on number of COVID-19 cases, entry requirements, safety scores and a lot more with some extra data about the searched destination using just one single API. And even more, safety information can be retrieved for the destination you would like to visit so that you will be aware of where you are heading to. There are two APIs to get this information, which we have grouped into the COVID-19 and Travel Safety category. Information Our catalogue of Self-Service APIs is currently organised by categories that are different to what you see on this page. APIs Description Travel Restrictions Provides up-to-date data on COVID-19 caseloads and travel restrictions for over 200 countries and territories, as well as hundreds of cities and regions worldwide. Safe Place Provides updated safety and security ratings for over 65,000 cities and neighborhoods worldwide, helping travelers consult and compare destination safety. Search by an area Travel Restrictions API can be searched by a country, city, or region . Information The country code (2 letters) is defined by ISO 3166 and the city code (3 letters) is defined by IATA . You can also use Airport & City Search API to get this information. Safe Place API can be searched by a given location with latitude, longitude and radius , or Square information (North, West, South, and East) or by id . curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/safety/safety-rated-locations?latitude = 48 .856614 & longitude = 2 .3522219 & radius = 2 curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/safety/safety-rated-locations/Q930400878 Information The id is given by your first query which has been searched by others. The search by Id was designed to target a specific area that you want to focus on. Get information from responses Let's highlight some information that you'll get from both Travel Restrictions API and Safe Place API. Warning Don't forget that Amadeus for Developers provides a Test Environment with limited data collections . Information the data for Travel Restrictions API comes from Riskline and it has been sourced from local governments and media. The quantity of information provided may vary from country to country. the data for Safe Place API comes from GeoSure GeoSafeScores algorithm, which analyzes crime, health and economic data, official travel alerts, local reporting, and a variety of other sources. Get summary of the destination + Safety score From the response of Travel Restrictions API: \"area\" : { \"name\" : \"South Korea\" , \"iataCode\" : \"KR\" , \"areaType\" : \"Country\" }, \"summary\" : \"<p>Authorities have relied on gathering limits and social distancing measures to contain outbreaks since the start of the pandemic.

The API provides a link to the Flight Offers Search API to search for flights once a destination is chosen and a link to the Flight Cheapest Date Search API to check the cheapest dates to fly: \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"BOS\" , \"destination\" : \"CHI\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2022-07-22\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2022-07-28\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"52.18\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDates\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin=BOS&destination=CHI&departureDate=2022-07-02,2022-12-28&oneWay=false&duration=1,15&nonStop=false&maxPrice=300&currency=USD&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=BOS&destinationLocationCode=CHI&departureDate=2022-07-22&returnDate=2022-07-28&adults=1&nonStop=false&maxPrice=300&currency=USD\" } } ] Search for destinations for a specific duration of stay For example, let's say a traveler wants to spend six days in a city but doesn't have a strong preference for the destination. With the Flight Inspiration Search API we can recommend the traveler the cheapest destinations based on the stay duration. This can be done using the parameter viewBy which returns flight destinations by DATE , DESTINATION , DURATION , WEEK , or COUNTRY . In our scenario we need to pass the value DURATION to the parameter viewBy , like in the example below. Also, as input we give a duration of six days and origin Miami. The departure date will be between the 1st and 3rd of September 2021. GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?departureDate=2021-09-01,2021-09-03&duration=6&origin=MIA&viewBy=DURATION { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"MIA\" , \"destination\" : \"MSP\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-09-01\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-09-07\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"136.79\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDates\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin=MIA&destination=MSP&departureDate=2021-09-01,2021-09-03&oneWay=false&duration=6&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MIA&destinationLocationCode=MSP&departureDate=2021-09-01&returnDate=2021-09-07&adults=1&nonStop=false\" } }, { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"MIA\" , \"destination\" : \"STT\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-09-02\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-09-08\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"137.36\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDates\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin=MIA&destination=STT&departureDate=2021-09-01,2021-09-03&oneWay=false&duration=6&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MIA&destinationLocationCode=STT&departureDate=2021-09-02&returnDate=2021-09-08&adults=1&nonStop=false\" } } As you can see, all the recommendations have a duration of six days and are sorted by the lowest price. The API also provides link to the Flight Offers Search API for each result in order to check for available flights. Search for cheapest flights regardless of the dates The Flight Cheapest Date Search API finds the cheapest dates to travel from one city to another. The API provides a list of flight options with dates and prices, and allows you to order by price, departure date or duration. Information This API returns cached prices. Once the dates are chosen, use the Flight Offers Search API to get real-time pricing and availability. The following example retrieves a list of flight-date objects containing pricing information given the origin and destination, and a range of dates: GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin = BOS & destination = CHI & departureDate = 2022 -08-15,2022-08-28 The API provides a link to the Flight Offers Search API to search for flights once a destination is chosen, in order to proceed with the booking flow. Search for best flight offers The Flight Offers Search API searches over 500 airlines to find the cheapest flights for a given itinerary. The API lets you search flights between two cities, perform multi-city searches for longer itineraries and access one-way combinable fares to offer the cheapest options possible. For each itinerary, the API provides a list of flight offers with prices, fare details, airline names, baggage allowances and departure terminals. Warning Flights from low-cost carriers and American Airlines are currently unavailable. The Flight Offers Search API starts the booking cycle with a search for the best fares. The API returns a list of the cheapest flights given a city/airport of departure, a city/airport of arrival, the number and type of passengers and travel dates. The results are complete with airline name and fares as well as additional information, such as bag allowance and pricing for additional baggage. The API comes in two flavors: Simple version: GET operation with few parameters but which is quicker to integrate. On steroids: POST operation offering the full functionalities of the API. The minimum GET request has following parameters: GET https://test.api.amadus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?adults = 1 & originLocationCode = BOS & destinationLocationCode = CHI & departureDate = 2022 -07-22 The API returns a list of flight-offer objects (up to 250), including information such as itineraries, price, pricing options, etc. \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" , \"id\" : \"1\" , \"source\" : \"GDS\" , \"instantTicketingRequired\" : false , \"nonHomogeneous\" : false , \"oneWay\" : false , \"lastTicketingDate\" : \"2022-07-02\" , \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"itineraries\" : [ ], \"price\" : { \"currency\" : \"EUR\" , \"total\" : \"22.00\" , \"base\" : \"13.00\" , \"fees\" : [ { \"amount\" : \"0.00\" , \"type\" : \"SUPPLIER\" }, { \"amount\" : \"0.00\" , \"type\" : \"TICKETING\" } ], \"grandTotal\" : \"22.00\" } } ] Search for flights including or excluding specific airlines If you want your search to return flights with only specified airlines, you can use the parameter includedAirlineCodes to consider specific airlines. For example, there is a traveler who wants to travel from Berlin to Athens only with Aegean Airlines (A3): GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?max=3&adults=1&includedAirlineCodes=A3&originLocationCode=BER&destinationLocationCode=ATH&departureDate=2022-12-06 With the parameter excludedAirlineCodes you can ignore specific airlines. For example, there is a traveler who wants to travel from Berlin to Athens ignoring both Aegean Airlines (A3) and Iberia (IB): GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?max=3&adults=1&excludedAirlineCodes=A3,IB&originLocationCode=BER&destinationLocationCode=ATH&departureDate=2021-09-06 Search for the best flight option The Flight Choice Prediction API predicts the flight your users will choose. Our machine-learning models have analyzed historical interactions with the Flight Offers Search API and can determine each flight\u2019s probability of being chosen. Boost conversions and create a personalized experience by filtering out the noise and showing your users the flights which are best for them. Here is a quick cURL example piping the Flight Offers Search API results directly to the prediction API. Let\u2019s look at flight offers for a Madrid-New York round trip (limiting to four options for this test illustration) curl --request GET \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers \\? origin \\= MAD \\& destination \\= NYC \\& departureDate \\= 2019 -08-24 \\& returnDate \\= 2019 -09-19 \\& adults \\= 1 \\ | curl --request POST \\ --header 'content-type: application/json' \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers/prediction --data @- The prediction API returns the same content as the Low Fare search with the addition of the choiceProbability field for each flight offer element. { \"data\" : [ { \"choiceProbability\" : \"0.9437563627430908\" , \"id\" : \"1558602440311-352021104\" , \"offerItems\" : [ ... ], \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" }, { \"choiceProbability\" : \"0.0562028823257711\" , \"id\" : \"1558602440311--1831925786\" , \"offerItems\" : [ ... ], \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" }, { \"choiceProbability\" : \"0.0000252425060482\" , \"id\" : \"1558602440311-480701674\" , \"offerItems\" : [ ... ], \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" }, { \"choiceProbability\" : \"0.0000155124250899\" , \"id\" : \"1558602440311--966634676\" , \"offerItems\" : [ ... ], \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" } ], \"dictionaries\" : { ... } }, \"meta\" : { ... } } } Search for flight offers for multiple cities Many travelers take advantage of their international trips to visit several destinations. Multi-city search is a functionality that lets you search for consecutive one-way flights between multiple destinations in a single request. The returned flights are packaged as a complete, bookable itinerary. To perform multi-city searches, you must use the POST method of the Flight Offers Search API . The API lets you search for up to six origin and destination city pairs. In the following example, we\u2019ll fly from Madrid to Paris, where we\u2019ll spend a couple of days, then fly to Munich for three days. Next, we\u2019ll visit Amsterdam for two days before finishing our journey with a return to Madrid. We'll use the following IATA city codes: MAD > PAR > MUC > AMS > MAD The request will look like this: curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers \\ -d '{ \u202f\u202f\"originDestinations\": [ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f{ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"id\":\u202f\"1\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"originLocationCode\":\u202f\"MAD\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"destinationLocationCode\":\u202f\"PAR\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"departureDateTimeRange\": { \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"date\":\u202f\"2022-10-03\" \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f}, \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f{ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"id\":\u202f\"2\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"originLocationCode\":\u202f\"PAR\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"destinationLocationCode\":\u202f\"MUC\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"departureDateTimeRange\": { \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"date\":\u202f\"2022-10-05\" \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f}, \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f{ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"id\":\u202f\"3\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"originLocationCode\":\u202f\"MUC\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"destinationLocationCode\":\u202f\"AMS\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"departureDateTimeRange\": { \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"date\":\u202f\"2022-10-08\" \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f}, \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f{ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"id\":\u202f\"4\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"originLocationCode\":\u202f\"AMS\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"destinationLocationCode\":\u202f\"MAD\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"departureDateTimeRange\": { \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"date\":\u202f\"2022-10-11\" \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f], \u202f\u202f\"travelers\": [ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f{ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"id\":\u202f\"1\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"travelerType\":\u202f\"ADULT\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"fareOptions\": [ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"STANDARD\" \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f] \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f], \u202f\u202f\"sources\": [ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"GDS\" \u202f\u202f], \u202f\u202f\"searchCriteria\": { \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"maxFlightOffers\":\u202f1 \u202f\u202f} }' Search using loyalty programs The Flight Offers Price API and the Seatmap Display API both accept Frequent Flyer information so end-users can benefit from their loyalty program. When adding Frequent Flyer information, please remember that each airline policy is different, and some require additional information, such as passenger name, email or phone number to validate the account. If the validation fails, your user won\u2019t receive their loyalty program advantages. Search for routes from a specific airport The Airport Routes API shows all destinations from a given airport. To follow up on our previous example, let's check where we can fly to from Madrid (MAD). The options are obviously quite broad, so we can limit the maximum number of results to 10. Keep in mind that this limit will apply from the beginning of the results list in the alphabetical order of the airport IATA codes. The request will look like this: curl --request GET \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airport/direct-destinations?departureAirportCode = MAD & max = 10 \\ So we can see the the following results: { \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 10 , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airport/direct-destinations?departureAirportCode=MAD&max=10\" } }, \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ALBACETE\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ABC\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"LANZAROTE\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ACE\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"MALAGA\" , \"iataCode\" : \"AGP\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ALGHERO\" , \"iataCode\" : \"AHO\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ALICANTE\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ALC\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ALGIERS\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ALG\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"AMMAN\" , \"iataCode\" : \"AMM\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"AMSTERDAM\" , \"iataCode\" : \"AMS\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ASUNCION\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ASU\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ATHENS\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ATH\" } ] } Search for routes for a specific airline The Airline Routes API shows all destinations for a given airline. To follow up on our previous example, let's check what destinations the British Airways fly to. There's definitely plenty of options, so we can limit the maximum number of results to two for the sake of simplicity. Keep in mind that this limit will apply from the beginning of the results list in the alphabetical order of the city names. The request will look like this: curl --request GET \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airline/destinations?airlineCode = BA & max = 2 \\ So we can see the the following results: { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"Bangalore\" , \"iataCode\" : \"BLR\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"Paris\" , \"iataCode\" : \"PAR\" } ], \"meta\" : { \"count\" : \"2\" , \"sort\" : \"iataCode\" , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airline/destinations?airlineCode=BA&max=2\" } } } Look up the airline ICAO code by the IATA code If we need to know the IATA code for a particular airline but only have the airline's ICAO code, the Airline Code Lookup API can help us out. Just specify the IATA code in the query and send out the request: curl --request GET \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/airlines?airlineCodes = BA \\ The response is pretty straightforward: { \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 1 , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/airlines?airlineCodes=BA\" } }, \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"airline\" , \"iataCode\" : \"BA\" , \"icaoCode\" : \"BAW\" , \"businessName\" : \"BRITISH AIRWAYS\" , \"commonName\" : \"BRITISH A/W\" } ] } Search for flight and fare availability With the Flight Availabilities Search API you can check the flight and fare availability for any itinerary. This refers to the full inventory of fares available for an itinerary at any given time. The concept of flight availability originated in the early days of flight booking as a way for agents to check what options existed for their travelers\u2019 itineraries. Here\u2019s an example request for a one-way flight from Mad (MIA) to Atlanta (ATL) for one traveler departing on December 12, 2021: POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/availability/flight-availabilities { \"originDestinations\" : [ { \"id\" : \"1\" , \"originLocationCode\" : \"MIA\" , \"destinationLocationCode\" : \"ATL\" , \"departureDateTime\" : { \"date\" : \"2021-11-01\" } } ], \"travelers\" : [ { \"id\" : \"1\" , \"travelerType\" : \"ADULT\" } ], \"sources\" : [ \"GDS\" ] } The response contains a list of available flights matching our request criteria (for the sake of this example, we only show the first result). Each flight availability includes descriptive data about the flight and an availabilityClasses list containing the available fare classes and the number of bookable seats remaining in each fare class. \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-availability\" , \"id\" : \"1\" , \"originDestinationId\" : \"1\" , \"source\" : \"GDS\" , \"instantTicketingRequired\" : false , \"paymentCardRequired\" : false , \"duration\" : \"PT1H54M\" , \"segments\" : [ { \"id\" : \"1\" , \"numberOfStops\" : 0 , \"blacklistedInEU\" : false , \"departure\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"MIA\" , \"at\" : \"2021-11-01T05:30:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"ATL\" , \"terminal\" : \"S\" , \"at\" : \"2022-11-01T07:24:00\" }, \"carrierCode\" : \"DL\" , \"number\" : \"2307\" , \"aircraft\" : { \"code\" : \"321\" }, \"operating\" : {}, \"availabilityClasses\" : [ { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"J\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"C\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"D\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"I\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"Z\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"W\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"Y\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"B\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"M\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"H\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"Q\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"K\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"L\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"U\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"T\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"E\" } ] } ] }, Note that airlines\u2019 bookable seat counters goe up to a maximum of 9, even if more seats are available in that fare class. If there are less than 9 bookable seats available, the exact number is displayed. Search branded fares Branded fares are airfares that bundle tickets with extras, such as checked bags, seat selection, refundability or loyalty points accrual. Each airline defines and packages its own branded fares and they vary from one airline to another. Branded fares not only help build brand recognition and loyalty, but also offer travelers an attractive deal as the incremental cost of the fare is usually less than that of buying the included services \u00e0 la carte. The Branded Fares Upsell API receives flight offers from the Flight Offers Search API and returns branded fares as flight offers which can be easily passed to the next step in the booking funnel. The booking flow is the following: Search for flights using the Flight Offers Search API . Find branded fare options for a selected flight using the Branded Fares Upsell API . Confirm the fare and get the final price using the Flight Offers Price API . Book the flight using the Flight Create Orders API . Let's see an example of how to search for branded fares. You can build the request by passing the flight-offer object from the Flight Offers Search API into the body of the POST request: POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-offers/upselling { \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"flight-offers-upselling\" , \"flightOffers\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" , \"id\" : \"1\" , \"source\" : \"GDS\" , \"instantTicketingRequired\" : false , \"nonHomogeneous\" : false , \"oneWay\" : false , \"lastTicketingDate\" : \"2022-06-12\" , \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 3 , \"itineraries\" : [ { \"duration\" : \"PT6H10M\" , \"segments\" : [ { \"departure\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"MAD\" , \"terminal\" : \"1\" , \"at\" : \"2022-06-22T17:40:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"FCO\" , \"terminal\" : \"1\" , \"at\" : \"2022-06-22T20:05:00\" }, \"carrierCode\" : \"AZ\" , \"number\" : \"63\" , \"aircraft\" : { \"code\" : \"32S\" }, \"operating\" : { \"carrierCode\" : \"AZ\" }, \"duration\" : \"PT2H25M\" , \"id\" : \"13\" , \"numberOfStops\" : 0 , \"blacklistedInEU\" : false }, { \"departure\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"FCO\" , \"terminal\" : \"1\" , \"at\" : \"2022-06-22T21:50:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"ATH\" , \"at\" : \"2022-06-23T00:50:00\" }, \"carrierCode\" : \"AZ\" , \"number\" : \"722\" , \"aircraft\" : { \"code\" : \"32S\" }, \"operating\" : { \"carrierCode\" : \"AZ\" }, \"duration\" : \"PT2H\" , \"id\" : \"14\" , \"numberOfStops\" : 0 , \"blacklistedInEU\" : false } ] } ], \"price\" : { \"currency\" : \"EUR\" , \"total\" : \"81.95\" , \"base\" : \"18.00\" , \"fees\" : [ { \"amount\" : \"0.00\" , \"type\" : \"SUPPLIER\" }, { \"amount\" : \"0.00\" , \"type\" : \"TICKETING\" } ], \"grandTotal\" : \"81.95\" , \"additionalServices\" : [ { \"amount\" : \"45.00\" , \"type\" : \"CHECKED_BAGS\" } ] }, \"pricingOptions\" : { \"fareType\" : [ \"PUBLISHED\" ], \"includedCheckedBagsOnly\" : false }, \"validatingAirlineCodes\" : [ \"AZ\" ], \"travelerPricings\" : [ { \"travelerId\" : \"1\" , \"fareOption\" : \"STANDARD\" , \"travelerType\" : \"ADULT\" , \"price\" : { \"currency\" : \"EUR\" , \"total\" : \"81.95\" , \"base\" : \"18.00\" }, \"fareDetailsBySegment\" : [ { \"segmentId\" : \"13\" , \"cabin\" : \"ECONOMY\" , \"fareBasis\" : \"OOLGEU1\" , \"class\" : \"O\" , \"includedCheckedBags\" : { \"quantity\" : 0 } }, { \"segmentId\" : \"14\" , \"cabin\" : \"ECONOMY\" , \"fareBasis\" : \"OOLGEU1\" , \"brandedFare\" : \"ECOLIGHT\" , \"class\" : \"O\" , \"includedCheckedBags\" : { \"quantity\" : 0 } } ] } ] } ] } } Search for personalized destination recommendations The Travel Recommendations API provides personalized destinations based on the traveler's location and an input destination, such as a previously searched flight destination or city of interest. For example, for a traveler based in San Francisco who has searched for multiple flights to Barcelona, what other similar destinations the API could recommend? The API takes as input the country of the traveler and the IATA code of the city that was searched, in our case this will be US and BCN respectively. GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/recommended-locations?cityCodes=BCN&travelerCountryCode=US The response will look like this: { \"type\" : \"flight-date\" , \"origin\" : \"SFO\" , \"destination\" : \"ROM\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-09-19\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-09-23\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"348.75\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDestinations\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=SFO&departureDate=2021-04-15,2021-10-11&oneWay=false&duration=1,15&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=SFO&destinationLocationCode=ROM&departureDate=2021-09-19&returnDate=2021-09-23&adults=1&nonStop=false\" } } If you want to take it to the next level, you can call the Flight Cheapest Date Search API to let the users know not only the recommended destinations but also what are the cheapest dates to visit any of these cities. For real-time flights, you can also call the Flight Offers Search API . The Travel Recommendations API has returned links to both APIs. Search for recommended nearby destinations With the Airport Nearest Relevant API you can find the closest major airports to a starting point. By default, results are sorted by relevance but they can also be sorted by distance , flights , travelers using the parameter sort . Information To get the latitude and longitude of a city you can use the Airport & City Search API using the city's IATA code. Let's call the Airport Nearest Relevant API to find airports within the 500km radius of Madrid. GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/airports?latitude=40.416775&longitude=-3.703790&radius=500 A part of the response looks like: { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subType\" : \"AIRPORT\" , \"name\" : \"AIRPORT\" , \"detailedName\" : \"BARCELONA/ES:AIRPORT\" , \"timeZoneOffset\" : \"+02:00\" , \"iataCode\" : \"BCN\" , \"geoCode\" : { \"latitude\" : 41.29694 , \"longitude\" : 2.07833 }, \"address\" : { \"cityName\" : \"BARCELONA\" , \"cityCode\" : \"BCN\" , \"countryName\" : \"SPAIN\" , \"countryCode\" : \"ES\" , \"regionCode\" : \"EUROP\" }, \"distance\" : { \"value\" : 496 , \"unit\" : \"KM\" }, \"analytics\" : { \"flights\" : { \"score\" : 25 }, \"travelers\" : { \"score\" : 25 } }, \"relevance\" : 5.11921 } What we want to do at this point, is to find the cheapest dates for all these destinations. We can do this by calling the Flight Cheapest Date Search API which finds the cheapest dates to travel from one city to another. Let's see, for example, the cheapest dates to fly to Barcelona in November 2021. GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin=MAD&destination=BCN&departureDate=2021-05-01,2021-05-30 { \"type\" : \"flight-date\" , \"origin\" : \"MAD\" , \"destination\" : \"BCN\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-05-29\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-06-11\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"73.61\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDestinations\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=MAD&departureDate=2021-05-01,2021-05-30&oneWay=false&duration=1,15&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MAD&destinationLocationCode=BCN&departureDate=2022-09-29&returnDate=2021-06-11&adults=1&nonStop=false\" }, { \"type\" : \"flight-date\" , \"origin\" : \"MAD\" , \"destination\" : \"BCN\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-05-05\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-05-06\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"79.67\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDestinations\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=MAD&departureDate=2021-05-01,2021-05-30&oneWay=false&duration=1,15&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MAD&destinationLocationCode=BCN&departureDate=2021-05-05&returnDate=2021-05-06&adults=1&nonStop=false\" } }, { \"type\" : \"flight-date\" , \"origin\" : \"MAD\" , \"destination\" : \"BCN\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-05-02\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-05-06\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"80.61\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDestinations\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=MAD&departureDate=2021-05-01,2021-05-30&oneWay=false&duration=1,15&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MAD&destinationLocationCode=BCN&departureDate=2021-05-02&returnDate=2021-05-06&adults=1&nonStop=false\" } } As you can see above, in the results we have a list of dates for a roundtrip from Madrid to Barcelona ordered by the lowest price. In the last step, we want to let the traveler perform a flight search for any of the above dates that are convenient for them. That is very easy with our APIs, as the Flight Cheapest Date Search API for each result contains a link to the Flight Offers Search API . For example, if we want to perform a flight search for the first result, we only have to take the link provided and make an API call: GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MAD&destinationLocationCode=BCN&departureDate=2021-05-29&returnDate=2021-06-11&adults=1&nonStop=false Search for a city that has an airport The Airport & City Search API finds airports and cities that match a specific word or a string of letters. Using this API, you can automatically suggest airports based on what the traveler enters in the search field. The API provides a list of airports/cities ordered by yearly passenger volume with the name, 3-letter IATA code, time zone and coordinates of each airport. The main difference between the Airport & City Search API and City Search API is that the Airport & City Search API only shows cities that have an airport, while the City Search API retrieves any city that matches a search keyword. Compare the flight price to histrocal fares When booking a flight, travelers need to be confident that they're getting a good deal. You can compare a flight price to historical fares for the same flight route using the Flight Price Analysis API . It uses an Artificial Intelligence algorithm trained on Amadeus historical flight booking data to show how current flight prices compare to historical fares and whether the price of a flight is below or above average. Let's see how it works. In our example we will be flying from Madrid (MAD) to Paris (CDG) on 12 December 2022. We will check prices in Euros for a one way ticket. GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/analytics/itinerary-price-metrics?originIataCode = MAD & destinationIataCode = CDG & departureDate = 2021 -03-21 & currencyCode = EUR & oneWay = true This is what we get in the response: { \"warnings\" : [ { \"code\" : 22443 , \"title\" : \"WARNING\" , \"detail\" : \"Unsupported currency code. Supported currencies are CAD,HKD,ISK,PHP,DKK,HUF,CZK,AUD,RON,SEK,IDR,INR,BRL,RUB,HRK,JPY,THB,CHF,SGD,PLN,BGN,TRY,CNY,NOK,NZD,ZAR,USD,MXN,ILS,GBP,KRW,MYR\" } ], \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"itinerary-price-metric\" , \"origin\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"MAD\" }, \"destination\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"CDG\" }, \"departureDate\" : \"2022-12-12\" , \"transportType\" : \"FLIGHT\" , \"currencyCode\" : \"EUR\" , \"oneWay\" : true , \"priceMetrics\" : [ { \"amount\" : \"29.59\" , \"quartileRanking\" : \"MINIMUM\" }, { \"amount\" : \"76.17\" , \"quartileRanking\" : \"FIRST\" }, { \"amount\" : \"129.24\" , \"quartileRanking\" : \"MEDIUM\" }, { \"amount\" : \"185.59\" , \"quartileRanking\" : \"THIRD\" }, { \"amount\" : \"198.15\" , \"quartileRanking\" : \"MAXIMUM\" } ] } ], \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 1 , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/analytics/flight-price-metrics?originIataCode=MAD&destinationIataCode=CDG&departureDate=2022-12-12&currencyCode=EUR&oneWay=True\" } } } Here we can see that the lowest price for such ticket should be 29.59 Euros and the highest 198.15 Euros. The first, medium and trird choices give you an idea about the possible price ranges for this flight. Confirm Fares The availability and price of airfare fluctuate, so it\u2019s important to confirm before proceeding to book. This is especially true if time passes between the initial search and the decision to book, as fares are limited and there are thousands of bookings occurring every minute. During this step, you can also add ancillary products like extra bags or legroom. For that you can use the Flight Offers Price API . Once a flight has been selected, you\u2019ll need to confirm the availability and price of the fare. This is where the Flight Offers Price API comes in. This API returns the final fare price (including taxes and fees) of flights from the Flight Offers Search as well as pricing for ancillary products and the payment information that will be needed to make the final booking. The body to be sent via POST is built by a new object of type flight-offers-pricing composed by a list of flight-offers (up to 6) + payment information. { \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"flight-offers-princing\" , \"flightOffers\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" } ], \"payment\" : [ { Payme nt _Objec t } ] } Return fare rules The Flight Offers Price API confirms the final price and availability of a fare. It also returns detailed fare rules, including the cancellation policy and other information. To get the fare rules, add the parameter include=detailed-fare-rules to your API call, as shown below: POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-offers/pricing?include = detailed-fare-rules Book a Flight Once the fare is confirmed, you\u2019re ready to use the Flight Create Orders API to perform the actual booking. This API lets you log a reservation in the airlines\u2019 systems and create a PNR , and returns a unique Id number and the reservation details. If you\u2019re using an airline consolidator, the PNR will be automatically sent to the consolidator for ticket issuance. Visit the Flight Create Orders documentation page for more details on this API. Remember, you need to be able to issue a ticket to make bookings with our Flight Create Orders API . To access the API in production, you need to either sign a contract with an airline consolidator or be accredited to issue tickets yourself. You can see the process step to step in this video tutorial . If you are interested in knowing more about issuing tickets in travel industry, please check out this article . Issue a ticket Once the booking is made, you need to complete payment. In most cases, you\u2019ll receive payment from the customer and then pay the airline, typically via an industry-specific settlement procedure like the BSP or ARC (more on those later). In the final step, a flight ticket is issued. In industry terms, a flight ticket is a confirmation that payment has been received, the reservation has been logged, and the customer has the right to enjoy the flight. For IATA member airlines , only certain accredited parties can issue tickets. In the next section, we\u2019ll go into detail about your options for managing this final step in the booking process. View the aircraft cabin layout With the Seatmap Display API you can view the aircraft cabin layout: deckConfiguration - the dimensions of the passenger deck in (x,y) coordinates, including the location of the wings, exit rows, and cabins. These dimensions form a grid on which you will later place facilities and seats. facilities - the (x,y) coordinates of aircraft facilities, such as bathrooms or galleys. seats - the (x,y) coordinates of all seats on the aircraft, with their respective availability status, characteristics, and prices. To help you build a more consistent display, the API returns a uniform width for all cabins and classes. Rows with special seating like business class or extra-legroom seats have fewer seats per row (e.g., 4 seats for width of 7 coordinates) than economy rows (e.g. 7 seats for a width of 7 coordinates). Check out this video tutorial for more details. Display in-flight amenities Both endpoints of the Seatmap Display API return information about the following in-flight amenities: Seat Wi-fi Entertainment Power Food Beverage Select a seat Requests to either endpoint of the Seatmap Display API will return a list of seating options with their characteristics, pricing, and coordinates. Let's look at an example response: { \"cabin\" : \"M\" , \"number\" : \"20D\" , \"characteristicsCodes\" : [ \"A\" , \"CH\" , \"RS\" ], \"travelerPricing\" : [ { \"travelerId\" : \"1\" , \"seatAvailabilityStatus\" : \"AVAILABLE\" , \"price\" : { \"currency\" : \"EUR\" , \"total\" : \"17.00\" , \"base\" : \"17.00\" , \"taxes\" : [ { \"amount\" : \"0.00\" , \"code\" : \"SUPPLIER\" } ] } } ], \"coordinates\" : { \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 4 } }, For each seat, the Seatmap Display API provides a seatAvailabilityStatus so you can indicate which seats are currently available for booking. Seats may have one of three\u202favailability statuses: AVAILABLE \u202f\u2013 the seat is\u202fnot occupied\u202fand\u202fis\u202favailable to book. BLOCKED \u202f\u2013\u202fthe seat is not occupied but isn\u2019t\u202favailable to book for the user. This is usually due to the passenger type (e.g., children may not sit in exit rows) or their fare class (e.g., some seats may be reserved for flyers in higher classes). OCCUPIED \u202f\u2013 the seat is\u202f occupied\u202fand\u202funavailable to book. If a flight is fully booked, the API returns an OCCUPIED status for all seats. In most cases, fully booked flights are filtered\u202fout during search with\u202fthe Flight Offers Search API \u202for when confirming the price with\u202fthe Flight Offers Price API .\u202fThe Flight Create Orders API returns an error message if you try to book an unavailable seat. For more information on the booking flow, check out how to build a flight booking engine. Once your user has selected their seat, the next step is to add the desired seat to the flight offer and prepare them for booking. In the above\u202fexample\u202fresponse,\u202fseat\u202f 20D is indicated as AVAILABLE . For your user to be able to book the seat, you must\u202fadd the seat to the flightOffer object and call Flight Offers Price \u202fto\u202fget a final order summary with the included seat. To include the seat in the flightOffer object, add it to\u202f fareDetailsBySegment \u2192 additionalServices \u2192 chargeableSeatNumber , as shown below: \"fareDetailsBySegment\" : [ { \"additionalServices\" : { \"chargeableSeatNumber\" : \"20D\" }, \"segmentId\" : \"60\" , \"cabin\" : \"ECONOMY\" , \"fareBasis\" : \"NLYO5L\" , \"brandedFare\" : \"LITE\" , \"class\" : \"N\" , \"includedCheckedBags\" : { \"quantity\" : 0 } } ] The Flight Offers Price API then returns the flightOffer object with the price of the chosen seat included within additionalServices : \"additionalServices\" : { \"type\" : \"SEATS\" , \"amount\" : \"17.00\" } You can use the same process to select seats for multiple passengers.\u202fFor each passenger, you must add the selected seats\u202fin\u202f fareDetailsBySegment \u202ffor each travelerId within the\u202fflight offer. At this point, you now have a priced flightOffer which includes your user's selected seat. The final step is to book the flight using the Flight Create Orders API . To do this, simply pass the flightOffer object into\u202fa request to the Flight Create Orders API , which will book the flight and return an order summary and a booking Id. Add additional baggage Search additional baggage options The first step is to find the desired flight offer using the Flight Offers Search API . Each flight offer contains an additionalServices field with the types of additional services available, in this case bags, and the maximum price of the first additional bag. Note that at this point, the price is for informational purposes only. To get the final price of the added baggage with the airline policy and the traveler's tier level taken into account, you must call the Flight Offers Price API . To do this, add the include=bags parameter in the path of the Flight Offers Price API : POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-offers/pricing?include = bags As you see below, the API returns the catalog of baggage options with the price and quantity (or weight): \"bags\" : { \"1\" : { \"quantity\" : 1 , \"name\" : \"CHECKED_BAG\" , \"price\" : { \"amount\" : \"25.00\" , \"currencyCode\" : \"EUR\" }, \"bookableByItinerary\" : true , \"segmentIds\" : [ \"1\" , \"14\" ], \"travelerIds\" : [ \"1\" ] } \"2\" : { \"quantity\" : 2 , \"name\" : \"CHECKED_BAG\" , \"price\" : { \"amount\" : \"50.00\" , \"currencyCode\" : \"EUR\" }, \"bookableByItinerary\" : true , \"segmentIds\" : [ \"1\" , \"14\" ], \"travelerIds\" : [ \"1\" ] } } The Flight Offers Price API returns two bag offers for the given flight. The catalog shows that either one or two bags are available to be booked per passenger. Higher bag quantity will be rejected due to the airline's policy. In the example above, the price of two bags is double that of one bag, though some airlines do offer discounts for purchasing more than one checked bag. Each bag offer is coupled to the specific segment and traveler Id returned in each bag offer. If there is no extra baggage service available, the API won\u2019t return a baggage catalog. Add additional baggage to the flight offer Next, you need to add the additional baggage to the desired flight segments. This gives you the flexibility to include extra bags on only certain segments of the flight. Fill in chargeableCheckedBags with the desired quantity (or weight, depending on what the airline returns) in travelerPricings/fareDetailsBySegment/additionalServices , as shown below: \"fareDetailsBySegment\" : [{ \"segmentId\" : \"1\" , \"cabin\" : \"ECONOMY\" , \"fareBasis\" : \"TNOBAGD\" , \"brandedFare\" : \"GOLIGHT\" , \"class\" : \"T\" , \"includedCheckedBags\" : { \"quantity\" : 0 }, \"additionalServices\" : { \"chargeableCheckedBags\" : { \"quantity\" : 1 } } }] Confirm the final price and book Once you\u2019ve added the desired bags to the flight order, you need to call the Flight Offers Price API to get the final price of the flight with all additional services included. Once this is done, you can then call the Flight Create Orders API to book the flight. If you want to add different numbers of bags for different itineraries, you can do it following the same flow. If the desired flight you want to book, does not permit the additional service, the Flight Create Orders API will reject the booking and return the following error: { \"errors\" : [{ \"status\" : 400 , \"code\" : 38034 , \"title\" : \"ONE OR MORE SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE\" , \"detail\" : \"Error booking additional services\" }] } Check the flight status The On-Demand Flight Status API provides real-time flight schedule data including up-to-date departure and arrival times, terminal and gate information, flight duration and real-time delay status. To get this information, just send a query with the IATA carrier code, flight number and scheduled departure date, and you'll be up to date about your flight schedule. Check for any flight delays For any traveller it's quite important to know how far in advance they should get to the airport. The Flight Delay Prediction API estimates the probability of a specific flight being delayed. Check the on-time performance of an airport Another way to get prepared for any delays, is checking the on-time performance of the actual airport. The Flight Delay Prediction API estimates the probability of a specific flight being delayed. The search query is very simple. In our query we only need to provide our flight departure date and the departure airport. For example, JFK on 12 December 2022. GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airport/predictions/on-time?airportCode = JFK & date = 2022 -12-12 This is the result: { \"data\" : { \"id\" : \"JFK20221212\" , \"probability\" : \"0.928\" , \"result\" : \"0.77541769\" , \"subType\" : \"on-time\" , \"type\" : \"prediction\" }, \"meta\" : { \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airport/predictions/on-time?airportCode=JFK&date=2022-12-12\" } } } The probability parameter shows the probability of the airport running smoothly. In our example, this metric means that there is a 92.8% chance that there will be no delays. Get a direct link to the airline check-in page Suppose we are building an app with an integrated check-in flow for a particular airline. In this case, we can leverage the Flight Check-in Links API to generate a link to the airline's official check-in page in a required language for both web and mobile platforms. The only parameter that we need to provide in our search query is the airline's IATA code. If required, we can request the links in a specific language, such as UK English (en-GB). This is what our request would look like: curl --request GET \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links?airlineCode = BA & language = en-GB \\ This is what we get in the response: { \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 3 , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links?airlineCode=BA&language=EN-GB\" } }, \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"checkin-link\" , \"id\" : \"BAEN-GBAll\" , \"href\" : \"https://www.britishairways.com/travel/olcilandingpageauthreq/public/en_gb\" , \"channel\" : \"All\" }, { \"type\" : \"checkin-link\" , \"id\" : \"BAEN-GBMobile\" , \"href\" : \"https://www.britishairways.com/travel/olcilandingpageauthreq/public/en_gb/device-mobile\" , \"channel\" : \"Mobile\" }, { \"type\" : \"checkin-link\" , \"id\" : \"BAEN-GBWeb\" , \"href\" : \"https://www.britishairways.com/travel/olcilandingpageauthreq/public/en_gb\" , \"channel\" : \"Web\" } ] } Here we've got a dedicated link for web applications, a dedicated link for mobile applications and a link that works on all platforms. Cancel a reservation Just as you can help users book a flight with the Flight Create Orders API , you can now also help them cancel their reservations with the Flight Order Management API. However, you have a limited window of time to cancel via API. If you\u2019re working with an airline consolidator for ticketing, cancellations via API are generally only allowed while the order is queued for ticketing. Once the ticket has been issued, you\u2019ll have to contact your consolidator directly to handle the cancellation. To call the Flight Order Management API , you have pass as a parameter the flight-orderId from the Flight Create Orders API, such as: DELETE https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/booking/flight-orders/eJzTd9f3NjIJdzUGAAp%2fAiY View reservation details With the Flight Order Management API you can consult and check your flight reservation. To call the Flight Order Management API , you have pass as a parameter the flight-orderId from the Flight Create Orders API , such as: GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/booking/flight-orders/eJzTd9f3NjIJdzUGAAp%2fAiY Common Errors Issuance not allowed in Self Service Self-Service users must work with an airline consolidator that can issue tickets on your behalf. In that case, the payment is not processed by the API but directly between you and the consolidator. Adding a form of payment to the Flight Create Orders API will be rejected by error INVALID FORMAT. Price discrepancy The price of airfare fluctuates constantly. Creating an order for a flight whose price is no longer valid at the time of booking will trigger the following error: { \"errors\" : [ { \"status\" : 400 , \"code\" : 37200 , \"title\" : \"PRICE DISCREPANCY\" , \"detail\" : \"Current grandTotal price (2780.28) is different from request one (2779.58)\" } ] } If you receive this error, reconfirm the fare price with the Flight Offers Price API before booking. The following is a common error in the test environment, as you can perform many bookings without restrictions (no real payment), but the inventory is a copy of the real one, so if you book many seats, the inventory will be empty and you won't be able to book anymore. { \"status\" : 400 , \"code\" : 34651 , \"title\" : \"SEGMENT SELL FAILURE\" , \"detail\" : \"Could not sell segment 1\" } Notes Carriers and rates Low cost carriers (LCCs), American Airlines are not available. Depending on the market, British Airways is also not available. Published rates only returned in Self-Service. Cannot access to negotiated rates, or any other special rates. Post-booking modifications With the current version of our Self-Service APIs, you can\u2019t add additional baggage after the flight has been booked. This and other post-booking modifications must be handled directly with the airline consolidator that is issuing tickets on your behalf. How payment works There are two things to consider regarding payments for flight booking: The payment between you (the app owner) and your customers (for the services provided + the price of the flight ticket). You decide how to collect this payment, it is not included in the API. A third party payment gateway, such as Stripe will be an easier solution for this. The payment between you and the consolidator (to be able to pay the airline and issue the flight ticket). This will be done between you and your consolidator of choice, and is to be agreed with the consolidator.","title":"Flights"},{"location":"resources/flights/#flights","text":"The Flights category contains a wide array of APIs that can help you manage flights, from searching for flight options to actually booking a flight.

Let's learn how to get started and help your users book the perfect rooms at over 150,000 hotels worldwide. Information This page has been updated based on Hotel Search V3 updates since MAY 2022. Search hotels Get a list of hotels by location First, users should be able to search hotels for a given location. The Hotel List API returns the list of hotels based on a city or a geographic code. To answer a question, such as \"what are the hotels closed to the city hall?\" the Hotel List API has three endpoints to utilize based on your search criteria. It returns hotel name , location , and hotel id for you to proceed to the next steps of the hotel search. Based on the search criteria, you will get the list of hotelId with hotel information as in the example below. { \"chainCode\" : \"AC\" , \"iataCode\" : \"PAR\" , \"dupeId\" : 700169556 , \"name\" : \"ACROPOLIS HOTEL PARIS BOULOGNE\" , \"hotelId\" : \"ACPARH29\" , \"geoCode\" : { \"latitude\" : 48.83593 , \"longitude\" : 2.24922 }, \"address\" : { \"countryCode\" : \"FR\" }, \"lastUpdate\" : \"2022-03-01T15:22:17\" } Search hotels by a city or Geocode You can specify an IATA city code or Geocode to search a more specific area to get the list of hotels. You can customize the request using parameters, such as radius, chain code, amenities, star ratings, and hotel source. For example: Using the by-city endpoint, get a list of hotels in Paris with a swimming pool and more than four stars: GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city?cityCode = PAR & amenities = SWIMMING_POOL & ratings = 4 ,5 Using the by-geocode endpoint, get a list of hotels in Paris (latitude=41.397158 and longitude=2.160873): GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-geocode?latitude = 41 .397158 & longitude = 2 .160873 Search hotels by hotel ids If you already know the Id of a hotel that you would like to check, you can use it to call the Hotel List API .

Hotel Ratings API returns ratings for many crucial elements of a hotel, such as sleep quality, services, facilities, room comfort, value for money, location and many others. Hotel Ratings API guarantees high-quality service for your customers. The sentiment analysis, just like the one below, is displayed in a simple flow to allow you to easily identify the best hotels based on traveler reviews: GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/e-reputation/hotel-sentiments?hotelIds = TELONMFS,ADNYCCTB,XXXYYY01 { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"hotelSentiment\" , \"numberOfReviews\" : 218 , \"numberOfRatings\" : 278 , \"hotelId\" : \"ADNYCCTB\" , \"overallRating\" : 93 , \"sentiments\" : { \"sleepQuality\" : 87 , \"service\" : 98 , \"facilities\" : 90 , \"roomComforts\" : 92 , \"valueForMoney\" : 87 , \"catering\" : 89 , \"location\" : 98 , \"pointsOfInterest\" : 91 , \"staff\" : 100 } }, { \"type\" : \"hotelSentiment\" , \"numberOfReviews\" : 2667 , \"numberOfRatings\" : 2666 , \"hotelId\" : \"TELONMFS\" , \"overallRating\" : 81 , \"sentiments\" : { \"sleepQuality\" : 78 , \"service\" : 80 , \"facilities\" : 75 , \"roomComforts\" : 87 , \"valueForMoney\" : 75 , \"catering\" : 81 , \"location\" : 89 , \"internet\" : 72 , \"pointsOfInterest\" : 81 , \"staff\" : 89 } } ] With these additional filters, your booking process becomes more efficient and you can offer your customers an enriched shopping experience. In this way, you can be confident that you are offering a highly rated hotels selection in the areas that customers appreciate the most. Check Availabilities and Prices Once users have explored the list of hotels in their desired area, they would want to check the price of a specific hotel or compare the prices of hotels on the list. With the hotelIds that you got from Hotel List API , you now can check the available rooms with real-time prices and room descriptions by calling the Hotel Search API . An example to request available rooms and prices for one room in Hilton Paris Opera for one adult with check-in date 2022-11-22: GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v3/shopping/hotel-offers?hotelIds = HLPAR266 & adults = 1 & checkInDate = 2022 -11-22 & roomQuantity = 1 The API returns a list of offers objects containing the price of the cheapest available room as well as information including the room description and payment policy. Note The response of Hotel Search V3 contains real-time data, so you don't need an additional validation step anymore. However, as there are thousands of people reserving hotels at any given second, the availability of a given room may change between the moment you search and the moment you decide to book. It is therefore advised that you proceed with booking as soon as possible or add a validation step by searching by offerid described below. { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"hotel-offers\" , \"hotel\" : { \"type\" : \"hotel\" , \"hotelId\" : \"HLPAR266\" , \"chainCode\" : \"HL\" , \"dupeId\" : \"700006199\" , \"name\" : \"Hilton Paris Opera\" , \"cityCode\" : \"PAR\" , \"latitude\" : 48.8757 , \"longitude\" : 2.32553 }, \"available\" : true , \"offers\" : [ { \"id\" : \"ZBC0IYFMFV\" , \"checkInDate\" : \"2022-11-22\" , \"checkOutDate\" : \"2022-11-23\" , \"rateCode\" : \"RAC\" , \"rateFamilyEstimated\" : { \"code\" : \"PRO\" , \"type\" : \"P\" }, \"commission\" : { \"percentage\" : \"8\" }, \"room\" : { \"type\" : \"A07\" , \"typeEstimated\" : { \"category\" : \"SUPERIOR_ROOM\" }, \"description\" : { \"text\" : \"ADVANCE PURCHASE\\nSUPERIOR ROOM\\nFREE WIFI/AIRCON\\nHD/ SAT TV/SAFE\" , \"lang\" : \"EN\" } }, \"guests\" : { \"adults\" : 1 }, \"price\" : { \"currency\" : \"EUR\" , \"base\" : \"359.01\" , \"total\" : \"361.89\" , \"taxes\" : [ { \"code\" : \"TOTAL_TAX\" , \"pricingFrequency\" : \"PER_STAY\" , \"pricingMode\" : \"PER_PRODUCT\" , \"amount\" : \"2.88\" , \"currency\" : \"EUR\" , \"included\" : false } ], \"variations\" : { \"average\" : { \"base\" : \"359.01\" }, \"changes\" : [ { \"startDate\" : \"2022-11-22\" , \"endDate\" : \"2022-11-23\" , \"base\" : \"359.01\" } ] } }, \"policies\" : { \"deposit\" : { \"acceptedPayments\" : { \"creditCards\" : [ \"VI\" , \"CA\" , \"AX\" , \"DC\" , \"DS\" , \"JC\" , \"CU\" ], \"methods\" : [ \"CREDIT_CARD\" ] } }, \"paymentType\" : \"deposit\" , \"cancellation\" : { \"amount\" : \"361.89\" , \"type\" : \"FULL_STAY\" , \"description\" : { \"text\" : \"Non refundable rate\" , \"lang\" : \"EN\" } } }, \"self\" : \"https://api.amadeus.com/v3/shopping/hotel-offers/ZBC0IYFMFV\" , \"cancelPolicyHash\" : \"F1DC3A564AF1C421C90F7DB318E70EBC688A5A70A93B944F6628D0338F9\" } ], \"self\" : \"https://api.amadeus.com/v3/shopping/hotel-offers?hotelIds=HLPAR266&adults=1&checkInDate=2022-11-22&roomQuantity=1\" } ] } If the time between displaying prices and booking the room is long enough to allow others to book the same room, you can consider requesting Hotel Search API again with the offerid that you got before. This is not mandatory as you always will see if the offer is available or not when you try to book the offer. An example to request the offer information with offer id : GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v3/shopping/hotel-offers/ZBC0IYFMFV Now that you have found the available offer (and its offerId ) with the price, you're ready to book! Booking the Hotel The Hotel Booking API \u202fis the final step in the hotel booking flow. By making a POST request with the offer Id returned by the Hotel Search API, the guest information, and the payment information, you can create a booking directly in the hotel reservation system. POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/booking/hotel-bookings \\ { \"data\" : { \"offerId\" : \"ZBC0IYFMFV\" , \"guests\" : [ { \"id\" : 1 , \"name\" : { \"title\" : \"MR\" , \"firstName\" : \"BOB\" , \"lastName\" : \"SMITH\" } , \"contact\" : { \"phone\" : \"+33679278416\" , \"email\" : \"bob.smith@email.com\" } } ] , \"payments\" : [ { \"id\" : 1 , \"method\" : \"creditCard\" , \"card\" : { \"vendorCode\" : \"VI\" , \"cardNumber\" : \"4151289722471370\" , \"expiryDate\" : \"2023-08\" } } ] , \"rooms\" : [ { \"guestIds\" : [ 1 ] , \"paymentId\" : 1 , \"specialRequest\" : \"I will arrive at midnight\" } ] } } ' Congratulations! You\u2019ve just performed your first hotel booking! Once the reservation is made, the API will return a unique booking confirmation ID which you can send to your users. Notes about Payment The Hotel Search API returns information about the payment policy of each hotel. The main policy types are: Guarantee : the hotel will save credit card information during booking but not make any charges to the account. In the case of a no-show or out-of-policy cancellation, the hotel may charge penalties to the card. Deposit : at the time of booking or by a given deadline, the hotel will charge the guest a percentage of the total amount of the reservation. The remaining amount is paid by the traveler directly at the hotel. Prepay : the total amount of the reservation fee must be paid by the traveler when making the booking. The current version of the Hotel Booking API only permits booking at hotels that accept credit cards. During the booking process, Amadeus passes the payment and guest information to the hotel but does not validate this information. Be sure to validate the payment and guest information, as invalid information may result in the reservation being canceled. As soon as your application stores transmits, or processes cardholder information, you will need to comply with\u202fPCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For more information, visit the PCI Security Council website . Guide for multiple hotel rooms Now that we have gone through the hotel booking flow, you may wonder how to proceed to booking more than two rooms in a hotel. Check availability and prices for multiple rooms The first step to booking multiple rooms is to search for hotels in your destination with the desired number of available rooms. You can do this by specifying the roomQuantity parameter when you call the Hotel Search API using the hotelid that you got from the Hotel List API . Here is an example of a search in Hilton Paris for two rooms for three adults : GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v3/shopping/hotel-offers?hotelIds = HLPAR266 & adults = 3 & checkInDate = 2022 -11-22 & roomQuantity = 2 The API will then return the available offers where roomQuantity is equal to 2. \"offers\" : [ { \"id\" : \"48E6C8C7DAA0BA5C22663E2A2A2B7629F5468BCBE2722FE4AB8174\" , \"roomQuantity\" : \"2\" , \"checkInDate\" : \"2022-11-22\" , \"checkOutDate\" : \"2022-11-23\" , Book multiple rooms with details for one guest To call the Hotel Booking API , you must provide details for at least one guest per offer (the offer contains all rooms for the reservation). For example, the JSON query below provides details of one guest to book two rooms by offerId : { \"data\" :{ \"offerId\" : \"F837D841218665647003CC9A8CA2A37CEC7276BBE14F9B9C525FBD1B7B69A8FF\" , \"guests\" :[ { \"name\" :{ \"title\" : \"MR\" , \"firstName\" : \"BOB\" , \"lastName\" : \"SMITH\" }, \"contact\" :{ \"phone\" : \"+33679278416\" , \"email\" : \"bob.smith@email.com\" } } ], \"payments\" :[ { \"method\" : \"creditCard\" , \"card\" :{ \"vendorCode\" : \"VI\" , \"cardNumber\" : \"4111111111111111\" , \"expiryDate\" : \"2026-01\" } } ] } } Once the booking is complete, the API will return the following confirmation: { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"hotel-booking\" , \"id\" : \"HA_36000507\" , \"providerConfirmationId\" : \"36000507\" , \"associatedRecords\" : [ { \"reference\" : \"R622XL\" , \"originSystemCode\" : \"GDS\" } ] }, { \"type\" : \"hotel-booking\" , \"id\" : \"HA_36000506\" , \"providerConfirmationId\" : \"36000506\" , \"associatedRecords\" : [ { \"reference\" : \"R622XL\" , \"originSystemCode\" : \"GDS\" } ] } ] } Book multiple rooms with guest distribution One common question is how to assign guest distribution among the booked rooms. When you call the Hotel Booking API , the rooms object represents the rooms. Each room contains guests distributed per room. Specifically, each room object needs IDs of the guests staying in that room. Below is a sample request to book two rooms with guest distribution. The first room is for guest ID\u2019s 1 & 2 and the second room for guest Id 3 . { \"data\" : { \"offerId\" : \"4A449AE835DD68F2E7C3571740FD00B76209D7311E719E3B66DE4E1100\" , \"guests\" : [ { \"id\" : 1 , \"name\" : { \"title\" : \"MR\" , \"firstName\" : \"BOB\" , \"lastName\" : \"SMITH\" }, \"contact\" : { \"phone\" : \"+33679278416\" , \"email\" : \"bob.smith@email.com\" } }, { \"id\" : 2 , \"name\" : { \"title\" : \"MRS\" , \"firstName\" : \"EMILY\" , \"lastName\" : \"SMITH\" }, \"contact\" : { \"phone\" : \"+33679278416\" , \"email\" : \"bob.smith@email.com\" } }, { \"id\" : 3 , \"name\" : { \"firstName\" : \"JOHNY\" , \"lastName\" : \"SMITH\" }, \"contact\" : { \"phone\" : \"+33679278416\" , \"email\" : \"bob.smith@email.com\" } } ], \"payments\" : [ { \"id\" : 1 , \"method\" : \"creditCard\" , \"card\" : { \"vendorCode\" : \"VI\" , \"cardNumber\" : \"4151289722471370\" , \"expiryDate\" : \"2026-08\" } } ], \"rooms\" : [ { \"guestIds\" : [ 1 , 2 ], \"paymentId\" : 1 , \"specialRequest\" : \"I will arrive at midnight\" }, { \"guestIds\" : [ 3 ], \"paymentId\" : 1 , \"specialRequest\" : \"I will arrive at midnight\" } ] } } The API response will be the same as when you booked multiple rooms using the details of just one guest: { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"hotel-booking\" , \"id\" : \"XK_88803316\" , \"providerConfirmationId\" : \"88803316\" , \"associatedRecords\" : [ { \"reference\" : \"MJ6HLK\" , \"originSystemCode\" : \"GDS\" } ] }, { \"type\" : \"hotel-booking\" , \"id\" : \"XK_88803315\" , \"providerConfirmationId\" : \"88803315\" , \"associatedRecords\" : [ { \"reference\" : \"MJ6HLK\" , \"originSystemCode\" : \"GDS\" } ] } ] \u200b Common Errors AcceptedPayments must be creditCards The current version of the Hotel Booking API only supports credit card payments, which are accepted by most hotels. The Hotel Search API returns the payment policy of each hotel under acceptedPayments in the policies section. Empty response from the View Room endpoint If you get an empty response from the Hotel Search API\u2019s second endpoint, then the hotel is fully booked and has no vacancy for the requested dates. If you don't use the checkInDate and checkOutDate parameters in the request, the API will return results for a one-night stay starting on the current date. If the hotel is full, the response will be empty. No rooms available at requested property { \"errors\" : [ { \"status\" : 400 , \"code\" : 3664 , \"title\" : \"NO ROOMS AVAILABLE AT REQUESTED PROPERTY\" } ] } The offer for the selected Hotel is no longer available.

Deposit : at the time of booking or by a given deadline, the hotel will charge the guest a percentage of the total amount of the reservation. The remaining amount is paid by the traveler directly at the hotel. Prepay : the total amount of the reservation fee must be paid by the traveler when making the booking. The current version of the Hotel Booking API only permits booking at hotels that accept credit cards. During the booking process, Amadeus passes the payment and guest information to the hotel but does not validate this information. Be sure to validate the payment and guest information, as invalid information may result in the reservation being canceled.

Information Our catalogue of Self-Service APIs is currently organised by categories that are different to what you see on this page. APIs Description Trip Parser Build a single itinerary with information from different booking confirmation emails. Trip Purpose Prediction Analyze a flight itinerary and predict whether the trip is for business or leisure. City Search Finds cities that match a specific word or string of letters. Parse the email confirmation into JSON The Trip Parser API helps to extract information from different booking confirmation emails and compile it into a single structured JSON itinerary. This API can parse information from flight , hotel , rail , and rental car confirmation emails. It provides the result of your parsing immediately, thanks to our algorithm. Encode your booking confirmation in Base64 The first step to parsing is to encode your booking confirmation file in Base64 format. This will give you the base of your API request. You should not add formatting or any other elements to your booking confirmation as it will affect the parsing. There are many tools and software that you can use for Base64 encoding. Some programming languages implement encoding and decoding functionalities in their standard library. In python , for example, it will look similar to this: import base64 with open ( \"booking.pdf\" , \"rb\" ) as booking_file : encoded_string = base64 . b64encode ( booking_file . read ()) print ( encoded_string ) Get the parsing results Next, add the encoded booking confirmation to the body of a POST request to the endpoint POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v3/travel/trip-parser { \"payload\" : \"your Base64 code here\" , \"metadata\" : { \"documentType\" : \"PDF\" , \"name\" : \"BOOKING_DOCUMENT\" , \"encoding\" : \"BASE_64\" } } documentType : pdf, xml, json or jpg encoding : BASE_64 or BASE_64_URL This will extract all the relevant data from the booking information into a structured JSON format, just like the example below. { \"data\" : { \"trip\" : { \"reference\" : \"JUPDRM\" , \"stakeholders\" : [ { \"name\" : { \"firstName\" : \"MIGUEL\" , \"lastName\" : \"TORRES\" } } ], \"products\" : [ { \"air\" : { \"departure\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-16T08:36:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-17T00:00:00\" }, \"marketing\" : { \"flightDesignator\" : { \"carrierCode\" : \"CM\" , \"flightNumber\" : \"644\" } } } }, { \"air\" : { \"departure\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-16T11:21:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-17T00:00:00\" }, \"marketing\" : { \"flightDesignator\" : { \"carrierCode\" : \"CM\" , \"flightNumber\" : \"426\" } } } }, { \"air\" : { \"departure\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-20T18:56:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-21T00:00:00\" }, \"marketing\" : { \"flightDesignator\" : { \"carrierCode\" : \"CM\" , \"flightNumber\" : \"645\" } } } } ] } } } Predict the trip purpose from a flight Another API in the itinerary management category, the Trip Purpose Prediction API , predicts whether a flight is searched for business or leisure .

Airport On-Time Performance Returns the estimated percentage of on-time flight departures for a given airport and date. Trip Purpose Prediction Provides insight into traveler motivation by predicting whether a trip is for business or leisure. Flight Delay Prediction API We used historical flight delay data to train a machine learning model to predict whether a flight will be on time or delayed. Calling the Flight Delay Prediction API is simple. You need to input basic information about the flight, including the carrier, airports and flight number to begin calling. Check out our API reference page to see the swagger with all the parameters. Here\u2019s an example for a flight from Frankfurt to Brussels: curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/travel/predictions/flight-delay?originLocationCode = BRU & destinationLocationCode = FRA & departureDate = 2022 -11-14 & departureTime = 11 :05:00 & arrivalDate = 2022 -11-14 & arrivalTime = 12 :10:00 & aircraftCode = 32A & carrierCode = LH & flightNumber = 1009 & duration = PT1H05M The API will return four possible delay categories: LESS_THAN_30_MINUTES BETWEEN_30_AND_60_MINUTES BETWEEN_60_AND_120_MINUTES OVER_120_MINUTES_OR_CANCELLED The API returns the corresponding probability of each delay length, so you\u2019ll know the statistical likelihood of each delay occurring. Ready to see the results of the flight to Brussels? Here\u2019s the output: \"data\" : [ { \"id\" : \"TK1816NCEIST20200801\" , \"probability\" : \"0.13336977\" , \"result\" : \"LESS_THAN_30_MINUTES\" , \"subType\" : \"flight-delay\" , \"type\" : \"prediction\" }, { \"id\" : \"TK1816NCEIST20200801\" , \"probability\" : \"0.42023364\" , \"result\" : \"BETWEEN_30_AND_60_MINUTES\" , \"subType\" : \"flight-delay\" , \"type\" : \"prediction\" }, { \"id\" : \"TK1816NCEIST20200801\" , \"probability\" : \"0.34671372\" , \"result\" : \"BETWEEN_60_AND_120_MINUTES\" , \"subType\" : \"flight-delay\" , \"type\" : \"prediction\" }, { \"id\" : \"TK1816NCEIST20200801\" , \"probability\" : \"0.09968289\" , \"result\" : \"OVER_120_MINUTES_OR_CANCELLED\" , \"subType\" : \"flight-delay\" , \"type\" : \"prediction\" } ] As you can see, the algorithm returns a 42.7% chance of a two-hour delay or eventual cancellation. Knowing this now, would you still make the decision to book the flight? We created this API because we want to empower travelers to make that choice. Airport On-Time Performance The Airport On-Time Performance API estimates the percentage of an airport\u2019s flights that will leave on time. We\u2019ve harnessed Amadeus historical data to predict the best airports for an speedy, stress-free flight. Give users meaningful context and empower them to make better choices about connecting flights and departure airports.

Calling the Flight Delay Prediction API is simple. You need to input basic information about the flight, including the carrier, airports and flight number to begin calling. Check out our API reference page to see the swagger with all the parameters. Here\u2019s an example for a flight from Frankfurt to Brussels: curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/travel/predictions/flight-delay?originLocationCode = BRU & destinationLocationCode = FRA & departureDate = 2022 -11-14 & departureTime = 11 :05:00 & arrivalDate = 2022 -11-14 & arrivalTime = 12 :10:00 & aircraftCode = 32A & carrierCode = LH & flightNumber = 1009 & duration = PT1H05M The API will return four possible delay categories: LESS_THAN_30_MINUTES BETWEEN_30_AND_60_MINUTES BETWEEN_60_AND_120_MINUTES OVER_120_MINUTES_OR_CANCELLED The API returns the corresponding probability of each delay length, so you\u2019ll know the statistical likelihood of each delay occurring. Ready to see the results of the flight to Brussels? Here\u2019s the output: \"data\" : [ { \"id\" : \"TK1816NCEIST20200801\" , \"probability\" : \"0.13336977\" , \"result\" : \"LESS_THAN_30_MINUTES\" , \"subType\" : \"flight-delay\" , \"type\" : \"prediction\" }, { \"id\" : \"TK1816NCEIST20200801\" , \"probability\" : \"0.42023364\" , \"result\" : \"BETWEEN_30_AND_60_MINUTES\" , \"subType\" : \"flight-delay\" , \"type\" : \"prediction\" }, { \"id\" : \"TK1816NCEIST20200801\" , \"probability\" : \"0.34671372\" , \"result\" : \"BETWEEN_60_AND_120_MINUTES\" , \"subType\" : \"flight-delay\" , \"type\" : \"prediction\" }, { \"id\" : \"TK1816NCEIST20200801\" , \"probability\" : \"0.09968289\" , \"result\" : \"OVER_120_MINUTES_OR_CANCELLED\" , \"subType\" : \"flight-delay\" , \"type\" : \"prediction\" } ] As you can see, the algorithm returns a 42.7% chance of a two-hour delay or eventual cancellation.

At Amadeus, we are following the contract-first approach to API development, which is at the core of the OpenAPI Generator's design philosophy. In this way, we only need to create or update an OpenAPI specification for a particluar API, and the OpenAPI Generator will automatically generate the SDKs in various programming languages and create the required API documentation. Amadeus OpenAPI specification We have a dedicated GitHub repository where you can find OpenAPI specification files for all our Self-Serving APIs. The OpenAPI Generator can easily consume these files to output a dedicated SDK for any of the languages that it supports. How to create an SDK from Amadeus OpenAPI specification If you are not familiar with the OpenAPI Generator, the following tutorial may help you get started. We will take Ruby as an example and show you the steps to create a turnkey SDK based on the specification for your required Amadeus API. We will use the City Search API in our example. Step 1. Setting up the OpenAPI Generator Information The current stable release version of the OpenAPI Generator at the time of writing this document is 6.0.1. There are many ways to set up the OpenAPI Generator. To eliminate the need for any system dependencies, we will run the OpenAPI Generator as a Docker container. As a prerequisite to this, we need to install the Docker Desktop on our host and start running it. Step 2. Downloading the OpenAPI specification for the City Search API Navigate to the Amadeus OpenAPI Specification and download the JSON file for the City Search API specification . Information You can use both JSON and YAML files with the OpenAPI Generator. Step 3. Creating the Ruby SDK for the City Search API Information The docker run command uses the openapi-generator-cli image: https://hub.docker.com/r/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the City Search API specification and run the following command: docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby This command uses the CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json as input ( -i ) located in the current directory ( /local/ ). It generates ( -g ) a Ruby SDK (indicated by ruby ) and outputs ( -o ) the files to folder city_search_ruby , which is located in the current directory ( /local/ ). Step 4. Enabling usage of the Ruby SDK for the City Search API Information Before using the API you will need to get an access token. Please read our Authorization Guide for more information on how to get your token. Navigate to the newly created city_search_ruby folder and open the README.md . This file shows the initial instructions on configuring our Ruby SDK for the City Search API. Follow the instructions in the README.md to build the code into a gem and install it locally by running the following command from the city_search_ruby directory: gem build ./openapi_client.gemspec gem install ./openapi_client-1.0.0.gem Information You may need to run this command with administrator privileges ( sudo ). Now we have a full-featured Ruby SDK that is ready for production usage. Step 5. Customising the Ruby SDK for the City Search API There are several ways to customise an SDK created by the OpenAPI Generator: Using a configuration file Using command line arguments Using mustache templates Configuration file There is a number of configuration options that the OpenAPI Generator supports for Ruby . To apply them, we need to create a JSON file with the required parameters and define it when running the OpenAPI Generator. Let's create a file called config.json with the following contents: { \"gemName\" : \"Amadeus_City_Search\" , \"gemSummary\" : \"A ruby wrapper for the Amadeus City Search API\" , \"moduleName\" : \"CitySearch\" , \"gemLicense\" : \"MIT\" , \"gemVersion\" : \"0.3.1\" , \"gemRequiredRubyVersion\" : \"2.1\" } To generate an SDK with these custom parameters, put the config.json file into the same directory as the source OpenAPI specification file and run: docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby \\ -c config.json \\ Command line arguments Instead of using a configuration file, we can specify the custom parameters as additional properties, separated by a comma: docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby \\ - -additional-properties gemVersion = 0 .3.1,gemName = Amadeus_City_Search You can otherwise specify the parameters directly, for example: --git-user-id openapi-generator-user --git-repo-id AmadeusCitySearch This command will upload the SDK to a repository AmadeusCitySearch by the user called openapi-generator-user . Mustache template To customise the SDK beyond the custom parameters, we can use mustache templates. The GitHub repository of the OpenAPI Generator contains default mustache templates at tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/ . For our Ruby Client SDK, we will need the api_client_spec template . Download the template and customise it as required. After that, attach the template to the OpenAPI run command as follows: docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby -t <path-to-template-directory> Replace <path-to-template-directory> with the path to the template directory. Step 6. Integrating the Ruby SDK for the City Search API with other libraries Suppose we want to integrate our City Search Ruby SDK into an existing application that already contains many models defined in third-party libraries. One of these models may contain a model whose name is the same as in our City Search Ruby SDK. A solution to this is to add a prefix to all models generated by OpenAPI Generator using the --model-name-prefix setting. For example: docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby --model-name-prefix Amadeus \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby In this way, all models in our SDK will be prefixed with Amadeus , e.g. AmadeusComponent . Conclusion In this tutorial we have seen how easy it is to generate a basic SDK from our API specification files using the OpenAPI Generator. We took Ruby as an example, but the OpenAPI Generator supports many other languages , so you can easily find a solution that meets your requirements.","title":"Using OpenAPI Generator"},{"location":"sdks/openapi-generator/#generating-sdks-from-amadeus-openapi-specification-using-the-openapi-generator","text":"The OpenAPI Generator is an open-source project for generating REST API clients, server stubs, documentation and schemas based on the OpenAPI specification.

Follow the instructions in the README.md to build the code into a gem and install it locally by running the following command from the city_search_ruby directory: gem build ./openapi_client.gemspec gem install ./openapi_client-1.0.0.gem Information You may need to run this command with administrator privileges ( sudo ). Now we have a full-featured Ruby SDK that is ready for production usage.","title":"Step 4.

Customising the Ruby SDK for the City Search API"},{"location":"sdks/openapi-generator/#configuration-file","text":"There is a number of configuration options that the OpenAPI Generator supports for Ruby . To apply them, we need to create a JSON file with the required parameters and define it when running the OpenAPI Generator. Let's create a file called config.json with the following contents: { \"gemName\" : \"Amadeus_City_Search\" , \"gemSummary\" : \"A ruby wrapper for the Amadeus City Search API\" , \"moduleName\" : \"CitySearch\" , \"gemLicense\" : \"MIT\" , \"gemVersion\" : \"0.3.1\" , \"gemRequiredRubyVersion\" : \"2.1\" } To generate an SDK with these custom parameters, put the config.json file into the same directory as the source OpenAPI specification file and run: docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby \\ -c config.json \\","title":"Configuration file"},{"location":"sdks/openapi-generator/#command-line-arguments","text":"Instead of using a configuration file, we can specify the custom parameters as additional properties, separated by a comma: docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby \\ - -additional-properties gemVersion = 0 .3.1,gemName = Amadeus_City_Search You can otherwise specify the parameters directly, for example: --git-user-id openapi-generator-user --git-repo-id AmadeusCitySearch This command will upload the SDK to a repository AmadeusCitySearch by the user called openapi-generator-user .","title":"Command line arguments"},{"location":"sdks/openapi-generator/#mustache-template","text":"To customise the SDK beyond the custom parameters, we can use mustache templates. The GitHub repository of the OpenAPI Generator contains default mustache templates at tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/ . For our Ruby Client SDK, we will need the api_client_spec template . Download the template and customise it as required. After that, attach the template to the OpenAPI run command as follows: docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby -t <path-to-template-directory> Replace <path-to-template-directory> with the path to the template directory.","title":"Mustache template"},{"location":"sdks/openapi-generator/#step-6-integrating-the-ruby-sdk-for-the-city-search-api-with-other-libraries","text":"Suppose we want to integrate our City Search Ruby SDK into an existing application that already contains many models defined in third-party libraries. One of these models may contain a model whose name is the same as in our City Search Ruby SDK. A solution to this is to add a prefix to all models generated by OpenAPI Generator using the --model-name-prefix setting. For example: docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby --model-name-prefix Amadeus \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby In this way, all models in our SDK will be prefixed with Amadeus , e.g. AmadeusComponent .","title":"Step 6.

Prerequisites Amadeus for Developers API key and API secret: to get one, create a free developer account and set up your first application in your Workspace . Python version >= 3.4 virtualenv when installing packages for your local projects. There are several beneficts of creating isolated environment, but the most interesting one is to avoid conflicts between different versions of the same package. The tool can be easily installed using pip : pip install virtualenv Next step is to create the environment. Switch to your project repository and type: virtualenv venv A new folder venv will be created with everything necessary inside. Let's activate the isolated environment with the following command: source venv/bin/activate From now on, all packages installed using pip will be located under venv/lib and not on your global /usr/lib folder. Finally, install the Amadeus SDK as follows: pip install amadeus You can also add it to your requirements.txt file and install using: pip install -r requirements.txt The virtual environment can be disabled by typing: deactivate Making your first API call This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a simple Python application which calls the Airport and Search API using the Amadeus for Developers Python SDK.

The library can also be initialized without any parameters when the environment variables AMADEUS_CLIEN_ID and AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET are present. The authentication process is handled by the SDK and the access token is renewed every 30 minutes. The SDK uses namespaced methods to create a match between the APIs and the SDK. In this case, the API GET /v1/reference-data/locations?keyword=LON&subType=AIRPORT is implemented as amadeus.reference_data.locations.get(keyword='LON',subType=Location.AIRPORT) . Handling the response Every API call returns a Response object. If the API call contains a JSON response, it will parse the JSON into the .result attribute. If this data also contains a data key, it will make that available as the .data attribute. The raw body of the response is always available as the .body attribute. print ( response . body ) #=> The raw response, as a string print ( response . result ) #=> The body parsed as JSON, if the result was parsable print ( response . data ) #=> The list of locations, extracted from the JSON Arbitrary API calls You can call any API not yet supported by the SDK by making arbitrary calls.
